Rarefaction analysis for avian biodiversity in relation to forest harvesting

This is the analysis associated with:
Wheelhouse, L.M., Hodder, D.P. & Otter, K.A.  2022.  The retention of non-commercial hardwoods in mixed stands maintains higher avian biodiversity than clear-cutting.  
Forestry "in press" 

The code is modified from examples in "A Quick Introduction to iNEXT via Examples" by Hsieh et al. 2019 - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/iNEXT/vignettes/Introduction.html  

This study compared the avian biodiversity, as detected using Autonomous Recording Units (ARU), in clear-cut forestry blocks versus blocks with partial retention of non-commercial 
hardwoods (mainly aspen and birch) and compared this with neighbouring uncut forest blocks.  The objective was to see whether retention of some stand structure would 
promote higher species diversity than the more commonly employed forestry practice in central British Columbia of clear-cut logging.
